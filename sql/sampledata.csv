Once tested and verified you will work with development teams to implement the algorithm as a scalable, hosted service.

We're looking for an experienced and creative data scientist who can conceptualize a project from start to finish, identifying the appropriate data and methodologies to use. Our Data Scientists work with open-source machine learning packages and libraries, so this position involves building custom ML/AI utilities from open-source resources in languages such as Python (preferred) and R. In this role, you will own and share technical solutions with both technical and non-technical stakeholders across multiple teams both internally and with external clients.

Responsibilities
Perform data analysis to understand the right combinations of data to meet outlined objectives
Translate client queries into actionable data pulls and help translate outputs into client strategies
Build and evaluate predictive modeling & machine learning utilities to produce meaningful outcomes that enable data-led decisions
